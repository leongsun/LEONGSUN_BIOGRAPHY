        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup>I grew up as a <b>naughty</b> and noisy kid who loved running around. 
            <sup>2</sup>I spent most of my time with classmates laughing over simple things. 
            <sup>3</sup>Toys were my favorite thing and I played with them for hours. 
            <sup>4</sup>I wasn't into gadgets yet because I preferred <i>physical play</i>. 
            <sup>5</sup>My childhood felt pure and joyful with lots of carefree moments. 
            <sup>6</sup>I loved going out with my family for <u>gala-gala</u> and bonding. 
            <sup>7</sup>We enjoyed eating together and trying new food. 
            <sup>8</sup>We also watched movies whenever we could. 
            <sup>9</sup>Playing at home or outdoors made every day <strong>exciting</strong>. 
            <sup>10</sup>Even though I was shy, I made friends easily at school. 
            <sup>11</sup>My classmates became my companions in fun and mischief. 
            <sup>12</sup>I looked forward to school like it was another playground. 
            <sup>13</sup>My schedule was the usual 6am to 2pm routine. 
            <sup>14</sup>After school I kept playing until dinner time. 
            <sup>15</sup>My parents made sure we spent time together as a family. 
            <sup>16</sup>As an <em>only child</em> I valued connecting with others. 
            <sup>17</sup>That's why I was always eager to play and bond with people. 
            <sup>18</sup>I slept early, usually around 8pm or 9pm. 
            <sup>19</sup>My days were long and full of energy. 
            <sup>20</sup>Looking back, childhood was a <mark>chill time</mark> in my life.

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup>As a teenager, life shifted from carefree to <b>demanding</b>. 
            <sup>2</sup>Stress started creeping in because decisions mattered more. 
            <sup>3</sup>Senior high made me choose a path for my future. 
            <sup>4</sup>I had to decide between <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics">STEM</abbr>, HUMSS, or ABM. 
            <sup>5</sup>I was always drawn to <strong>technology</strong> since childhood. 
            <sup>6</sup>I liked automation, coding, and how systems worked. 
            <sup>7</sup>So choosing STEM felt right for me. 
            <sup>8</sup>It was tough at first but my interests guided me. 
            <sup>9</sup>Gadgets became a bigger part of my life. 
            <sup>10</sup>School work required using <i>technology</i> more often. 
            <sup>11</sup>Playing with toys slowly faded away. 
            <sup>12</sup>This time became about <em>exploration</em> and curiosity. 
            <sup>13</sup>I wanted to learn new things I never tried before. 
            <sup>14</sup>I got into sports like <u>soccer</u>. 
            <sup>15</sup>I also discovered music through the violin. 
            <sup>16</sup>This was when I tried <code>coding</code> for the first time. 
            <sup>17</sup>My school schedule grew longer than before. 
            <sup>18</sup>I became pickier with friendships. 
            <sup>19</sup>Conversations felt more mature and intimidating. 
            <sup>20</sup>My teenage years taught me <mark>bravery and voice</mark>.

        <h2 style="color: #555;">College Years</h2>
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup>College hit different with all the new pressures. 
            <sup>2</sup>Unlike senior high, this felt like the <b>real deal</b>. 
            <sup>3</sup>I worried about professors, classmates, and pressure. 
            <sup>4</sup>These thoughts made me anxious during my first weeks. 
            <sup>5</sup>My schedule was shocking compared to before. 
            <sup>6</sup>College gave more freedom but demanded <strong>long hours</strong>. 
            <sup>7</sup>Some days I left at 7am and got home at 6pm. 
            <sup>8</sup>Commuting in Manila traffic was another challenge. 
            <sup>9</sup>Rush hour made every trip <em>exhausting</em>. 
            <sup>10</sup>By the time I got home I felt drained. 
            <sup>11</sup>Classes, projects, and deadlines were constant. 
            <sup>12</sup>Managing time became <i>critical</i>. 
            <sup>13</sup>College wasn't just studying but balancing everything. 
            <sup>14</sup>My social life became more meaningful. 
            <sup>15</sup>I learned to be very social with classmates. 
            <sup>16</sup>We went out for <u>gala-gala</u> during free time. 
            <sup>17</sup>I took my <mark>programming hobby</mark> seriously. 
            <sup>18</sup>I joined hackathons to gain experience. 
            <sup>19</sup>I learned independence and responsibility. 
            <sup>20</sup>My sleep got worse, sometimes sleeping at 2am because of projects and doom scrolling.
